  * Updated to version 1.3 of debmany provided by Michael Arlt:
    - add bash_completion example into examples
    - add less to Depends, as it is the default viewer for other files.
    - add zenity to Suggests, it is a graphical alternative for dialog.
  * Fix popbugs to prevent it from removing temporary files before the browser 
    has opened them, thanks to Chris Lamb for the bug report and the fix
    (Closes: #471752)
  * checkrestart:
    - Add /usr/lib/locale/ to the list of exceptions to prevent false
    positives when locales are reconfigured.
    - Change os.popen call to a subprocess.Popen call since python 2.5 does
    not seem to like lists in os.popen and because subprocess is preferable
    here.
    - Recode the utility so that the checks for deleted files and descriptors
    is not duplicated.
    - Remove the (useless) check for deleted descriptor
    - Rewrite the handling of lsof results to be more accurate and
    understandable.
    - Add a 'verbose' option that makes it list all the (supposedly) deleted
    files and descriptors used by the processes (Closes: #466811, #475397) -
    Add icon-theme.cache  to the list of deleted files that will be flagged
    (Closes: #469133)
    - Fix properly the handling of /usr as a symlink, the code had some stuff
      that was used as test case and should have been replaced before
      uploading, oops. (Closes: #405040)
   * Add myself to author list in debian/copyright, and fixed a lintian
     warning there too.

    * Find init.d scripts even if not provided in the package by looking

    even though they use the init script (such as active ssh connections). And
    need to be restarted manually (Closes: #290265)

  [ Fixes I would like to see in etch, even though we're on freeze now ]
  * Fix checkrestart with patch provided by Justin Pryzby, modify to reduce
    false positives by not complaining about deleted inodes/files under
    /tmp/, /var/log/ or named /SYSV. This fixes the long-standing issue that
    made this script rather useless (related to lsof, see bug #297029, and to
    changes in dpkg)  (Closes: #264985)
    (Note I have included the code from Sam Morris, available at
    http://robots.org.uk/src/psdel and contributed in the BTS. But it still
    needs to be massaged to work as a replacement for lsof)
  * Write a manpage for checkrestart so administrators are aware that this  
    tool should not be completely relied on. (Closes: #305279)
  * Update the version of network-test which fixes some of the bugs already
    fixed in the experimental 'ifupdown-extra' package:
    [ Note: Post-etch network-test will be removed from this package but
      I rather not try to introduce an experimental package such as
      ifupdown-extra into etch right now ]
      * Make network-test use bash (Closed: #401363)
      * Do not analyse resolv.conf lines that have been commented out.
      * Change network-test so it does not complain loudly if ethtool is not
        installed (just recommends its installation)
      * Fix duplicate spaces in the script as well as some typos with patch
        provided by Norbert Kiesel (Closed: #400463)
      * Change behaviour of network-test when testing ethernet link 
        (based on ifupdown-extra's 'check-network-cable' tests) this is better
        (and more reliable) than just using 'ifconfig' but requires users
        install additional software.

    - debget --help (or -h) now works as expected. Introduce usage
      in the tool to warn on errors when calling it (Closes: #251353)
    - Any other options are rejected (as they would be passed on to apt)
    - Additional error checking in debget to prevent it from going ahead
      when something goes wrong, this includes checking first if the
      apt-get dependencies are right and that the package the user asked
      us to retrieve exists (Closes: #283401)
    - Use apt-cache instead of apt-get to get the version as
      'apt-get -q2 -s --reinstall install' requires, for some reason,
      super cower powers. This makes it possible to download packages
      without satisfying dependencies (Closes: #369494)

      is not supported both in the manpage and in the program's output
      (Closes: #224857)

    generated by pod2man (Closes #228302, #305802)

  * Move checkrestart to /usr/sbin (Closes: #329723)
  * Have dglob exit with a '1' exit status if no packages match the globbing
