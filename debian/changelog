  * Include patch from Jiri Palecek that makes checkrestart work
  with processes that lack a proper link /proc/$PID/exe. This seems to happen
  with UML processes and confused the program. (Closes: 522850)
  * Include patches provided by Joerg Sommer for checkrestart:
  (Closes: 511537) 
     -  Set locale to POSIX ('C') since the output of dpkg is localized and
        localisations makes the match for diversions fail.
     - Skip the last output line from diversions since it is a summary
       listing packages that are part of a diversion.
     - Use dpkg-query instead of dpkg since dpkg-query is the generic interface
       for querying the dpkg database is dpkg-query, and dpkg is only a 
       wrapper for it.
     - Removed useless check in the isdeletedFile function that covers
       mutt in /tmp since there is already a match for /tmp
  * checkrestart: don't complain about processes that have deleted files
    in /var/tmp

    not seem to like lists in os.popen and because subprocess is preferable
    here.
    - Recode the utility so that the checks for deleted files and descriptors
    is not duplicated.
    - Remove the (useless) check for deleted descriptor
    - Rewrite the handling of lsof results to be more accurate and

    - Add a 'verbose' option that makes it list all the (supposedly) deleted

    Add icon-theme.cache  to the list of deleted files that will be flagged

  * which-pkg-broke now looks in Pre-Depends thanks to the patch submitted by
    Josh Triplett (Closes: #394950)
  * Network-test changes:

    - correctly detects an interface as UP if it has been forced to a
      given speed (Closes: #396336)
    - do not test nameservers that have been commented out from resolv.conf

  * Taking up this package as new maintainer, after talking with Matt
    on private mail.
  * Fix Frank Lichtenheld's mail in all manpages (Closes: #249818)
  * Changes to debget:
    - debget --help (or -h) now works as expected. Introduce usage
      in the tool to warn on errors when calling it (Closes: #251353)
    - Any other options are rejected (as they would be passed on to apt)
    - Additional error checking in debget to prevent it from going ahead
      when something goes wrong, this includes checking first if the
      apt-get dependencies are right and that the package the user asked
      us to retrieve exists (Closes: #283401)
    - Use apt-cache instead of apt-get to get the version as
      'apt-get -q2 -s --reinstall install' requires, for some reason,
      super cower powers. This makes it possible to download packages
      without satisfying dependencies (Closes: #369494)
    - Document the fact that downloading packages from the package cache
      is not supported both in the manpage and in the program's output
      (Closes: #224857)
  * Fix manpage dglob typos as well as the header of the documentation
    generated by pod2man (Closes #228302, #305802)
  * Have debman use bash as a shell (Closes: #369762)
  * Set LC_NUMERIC to 'C' in dpigs as suggested by Bill Allombert (Closes:
    #368227)
  * Move checkrestart to /usr/sbin (Closes: #329723)
  * Have dglob exit with a '1' exit status if no packages match the globbing
    pattern (Closes: #292585)
  * Make popbugs properly extract the file provided by the user instead of
    /var/log/popularity-contest, if requested to (Closes: #263471)
  * Fix typo in popbugs.1 manpage (AUTOR -> AUTHOR)
  * Include which-pkg-broke Python script contributed by Bill Gribble and
    wrote its associated manpage (Closes: #231470)
  * Include network-test shell script contributed by myself and
    wrote its associated manpage (Closes: #307694)
  * Use debhelper compatibility version 4

  * Switch debget from using python-apt to calling apt-get.  The things
    that it really needs aren't exposed by the python-apt API, and this
    makes it possible to use the same version specifications used with
    apt-get install (/stable, =1.2.0-1, etc.).  However, it may refuse to
    work if you have packages in broken states.
