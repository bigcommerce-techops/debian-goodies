Description: Small toolbox-style utilities for Debian systems
 These programs are designed to integrate with standard shell tools,
 extending them to operate on the Debian packaging system.
 .
  dgrep  - Search all files in specified packages for a regex
  dglob  - Generate a list of package names which match a pattern
 .
 These are also included, because they are useful and don't justify
 their own packages:
 .
  debget       - Fetch a .deb for a package in APT's database
  dpigs        - Show which installed packages occupy the most space
  debman       - Easily view man pages from a binary .deb without extracting
  checkrestart - Help to find and restart processes which are using old
                 versions of upgraded files (such as libraries)
  popbugs      - Display a customized release-critical bug list based on
                 packages you use (using popularity-contest data)
